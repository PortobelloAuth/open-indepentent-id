# Open Independent ID

Open Independent ID is a self sovereign ID specification that allows users to
maintain their own independent issuer of ID tokens and public signing keys
without revealing their demographic information or otherwise compromising their
privacy. It makes use of digital notaries that act as witnesses of the issuance
of a signature specific public signing key by the user, with more than one such
witness employed for each issuance.

## Companion Specifications

Open Independent ID is intended to be used with the
[Open Person Matching](https://github.com/PortobelloAuth/open-person-matching)
and
[Independent Identity Endorsements](https://github.com/PortobelloAuth/independent-id-endorsements)
specifications to create a digital Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and
Privacy framework that allows individuals control of their own identity and
accounts, including delegated, limited access by human and automated agents,
without account sharing and other insecure practices.
